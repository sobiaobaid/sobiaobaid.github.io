      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <h2><p>I’m <strong>Sobia Obaid</strong>, a <strong>Computer Systems Engineer</strong> and a <strong>dedicated Educator</strong> </p></h2>

 <p> I earned my Bachelor's and Master of Engineering degrees from <strong>NED University of Engineering and Technology </strong>, graduating with distinction in both programs. My academic excellence was recognized with a <strong>gold medal</strong>, a testament to my commitment to the field.</p>

<p>Since beginning my teaching career at <strong>NEDUET in 2007 </strong>, I have accumulated extensive experience as a lecturer and academic mentor. Over the years, I have guided numerous students in the areas of computer science and software development. </p>
<p>In addition to my university-level teaching, I also offer A Level tuition for Computer Science, specializing in exam preparation and conceptual understanding.</p>
<p>I am passionate about helping students build a strong foundation in computer science and programming concepts to support their growth as confident and capable problem-solvers.

     
      <p>Besides my academic pursuits, I’m an <strong>art lover</strong> and enjoy painting landscapes and nature-inspired art.</p>
